# CIT 281 Lab 08

## Overview  
Lab 08 focused on working with REST APIs and asynchronous operations using `fetch()` in Node.js. I created an Express server that called an external API (JSONPlaceholder) to retrieve and serve photo data. The lab combined skills from earlier labs—including routing, modules, and Promises—to build a server that could asynchronously retrieve, format, and return structured JSON data.

## Objectives  
- Create an Express server using Node.js  
- Use the native `fetch()` API to call an external REST endpoint  
- Process asynchronous data using Promises and `.then()` chains  
- Serve a frontend HTML file from a `public` subfolder using `express.static()`  
- Return JSON responses to client requests  
- Handle errors during asynchronous fetch calls  

## Deliverables  
- A server file using Express with one or more routes for API interaction  
- A `fetch()` call to JSONPlaceholder or similar public API  
- A frontend HTML file loaded from a `public` directory  
- A screenshot or `.txt` log of API data retrieval and display  
- Any supporting `.js` files used to modularize fetch logic  

## What I Learned  
This lab helped me understand how to fetch and serve external data through a custom Express server. I learned how to structure server routes that interact with REST APIs asynchronously and how to serve both backend data and static frontend content in the same project. This reinforced concepts of full-stack application flow and error handling in asynchronous code.
